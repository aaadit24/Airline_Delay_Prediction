# Airline_Delay_Prediction

### Abstract

This project aims to develop a utility-based probabilistic agent for predicting flight delays using a dataset containing 539,383 flight records. It consists of nine columns: id(unique number), Airline(Common US Airlines), Flight(flight number), Airport From(Airport of departure), Airport to(Airport of Arrival), DayOfWeek(Day of week), Time(Time in minute from 12am midnight), Length(Length of flight in minutes), and Delay(Binary value of delay or not) The agent's PEAS framework consists of: Performance measure - prediction accuracy of flight delays and minimization of false negatives; Environment - flight schedules, routes, and historical delay patterns; Actuators - delay probability assessments and early warning notifications; Sensors - flight information including airline, route, day, time, and flight duration. We will implement a Bayesian Network to model the conditional dependencies between flight features (airline, origin/destination airports, day of week, time, and flight length) and delay outcomes. The agent will use maximum likelihood estimation to learn probability distributions from historical data and apply Bayes' theorem to update delay probabilities as new flight information becomes available. This project addresses the practical challenge of flight delay prediction while demonstrating the application of probabilistic reasoning in real-world transportation systems.
